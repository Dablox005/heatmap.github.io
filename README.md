HeatMap project using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3 svg-based visualization library.
In this Data Visualization Project, I built a Heatmap to present different types of data with the D3.js library.
D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.
